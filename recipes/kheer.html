    <p><strong>Indian Rice pudding aka Kheer</strong></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Kheer, a beloved South Asian dessert, transcends the simple label of "rice pudding." 
        This creamy dish is comfort in a bowl, traditionally made with just a handful of ingredients: rice, milk, and sugar. 
        But simplicity is deceptive. The milk is simmered low and slow, patiently coaxing out its richness as the rice plumps and softens. 
        Cardamom pods, gently crushed to release their warm, exotic aroma, add a touch of magic. The result is a pudding that's both luxurious and subtly sweet
