    <p><strong>Authentic Indian naan </strong></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Naan is a leavened, oven-baked flatbread that's a staple in South Asian cuisine. 
        Unlike pita bread, which puffs up into a pocket during baking, naan stays flat. 
        The dough is typically enriched with yogurt, ghee (clarified butter), or milk, giving it a softer and richer texture than pita. 
        Traditionally, naan is cooked in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven heated by charcoal or wood. 
        The intense heat of the tandoor cooks the naan quickly, charring the surface and creating a smoky flavor.

        You can enjoy naan in many ways. 
        It's perfect for scooping up curries and stews, soaking up flavorful sauces, or using as a base for mini pizzas. 
        Naan can also be stuffed with savory fillings like vegetables or cheese, making it a satisfying hand-held meal.

            Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, yogurt, and 1/2 of the ghee.
