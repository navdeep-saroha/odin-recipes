    <p><strong>An Indian style Cottage Chesse Curry</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The original shahi paneer is from Mughalai cuisine.
        It has a white gravy made from onion and yogurt. 
        No tomatoes are added. Full of nuts, saffron and aromatic spices. 
        Very few spice powders are used
        in the gravy hence it has mild yet tasty flavors
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe is the Punjabi version of shahi paneer. 
        Of course, it is inspired by the Mughlai version but with a completely different flavor profile. 
        Tomatoes and spices (along with saffron & aromatics) are used here, 
        so it has orangey-red colored gravy just like typical Punjabi gravies

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak cashew nuts in hot water for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Warm up the heavy cream in the microwave for a few seconds. 
                Take few saffron strands, crush and add to the warm cream. 
                Mix and keep it aside. 
                Over time saffron releases its flavor and color into the cream.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Now take onion, ginger, garlic, green chili, cloves, cinnamon and cardamoms in a saucepan. 
                Also, add â…“ cup of water and turn the heat on medium. 
                Let it cook for 8-10 minutes or until the onions become soft. 
                Let it cool down.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Now make purees in the following order:
                First, make cashew paste. 
                Then grind cooked onion into a fine paste
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Heat the ghee in a pan on medium heat.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Mix, cook until all the moisture is evaporated and it becomes a thick paste. So stir in between and make sure that it is not sticking to the sides and bottom of the pan. If it is spluttering too much then you can partially cover the pan.
