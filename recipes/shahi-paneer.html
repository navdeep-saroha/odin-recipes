    <p><strong>An Indian style Cottage Chesse Curry</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The original shahi paneer is from Mughalai cuisine.
        It has a white gravy made from onion and yogurt. 
        No tomatoes are added. Full of nuts, saffron and aromatic spices. 
        Very few spice powders are used
        in the gravy hence it has mild yet tasty flavors

    <p>
        This recipe is the Punjabi version of shahi paneer. 
        Of course, it is inspired by the Mughlai version but with a completely different flavor profile. 
        Tomatoes and spices (along with saffron & aromatics) are used here, 
        so it has orangey-red colored gravy just like typical Punjabi gravies
